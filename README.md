# Hi, I'm Ryan!

I'm a data science enthusiast. I enjoy everything about the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence: experimenting, developing and tuning models, studying the [latest research papers in ML](https://paperswithcode.com/), testing new ideas, and feeling wonder and awe at the "magic" of what can be accomplished with linear algebra, backpropagation, and lots of training data.

If you're new here, check out my [ml-projects](https://github.com/rparkr/ml-projects) repo, which is my incubation space for various ideas and projects I've worked on.
